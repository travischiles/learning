    About Me...
  </h2>
  <p>
    Travis Chiles is a native of South Carolina, and received his BA in Experimental Psychology from the University of South Carolina where his studies focused on motor movement learning and dance education. His involvement in the performance arts
    and dance began at an early age and continued through college where, most notably, Chiles founded a student run dance company and charitable organization. <br />
    <br />
    While pursuing his degree, Chiles spent his summers performing with the Madison Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps where he later returned to teach for two summers. This summer would have been third as choreographer, movement designer, and visual
    designer/merchandiser for The Academy. Prior to beginning his education and design career, Chiles also performed with Etude and Paramount World Winter Guard. <br />
    <br />
    Travis currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia where he programs, choreographs, and instructs movement for several programs including Ola HS, Hoover HS, and the Paramount World Winter Guard. He has instructed and choreographed for numerous other
    programs across the country including Kennesaw Mountain HS, East Cowheta HS, Marcus HS, Blue Springs HS, and Paramount Open. In addition to teaching, he designs flags, floors, and other graphics for a number of indoor and outdoor groups. Any
    remaining free time he has is devoted to taking dance classes and studying all forms of visual art!
